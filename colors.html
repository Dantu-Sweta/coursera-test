	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"> <p><span id="s1"> Yellow </span><br><br>
	Yellow is the most luminous of all the colors of the spectrum. It’s the color that captures our attention more than any other color. It’s the color of happiness, and optimism, of enlightenment and creativity, sunshine and spring.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"> <p> <span id="s2"> Blue </span><br><br>
	Blue is the favorite color of all people. It’s nature’s color for water and sky, but is rarely found in fruits and vegetables. Today, blue is embraced as the color of heaven and authority, denim jeans and corporate logos. It is cold, wet, and slow as compared to red’s warmth, fire, and intensity</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><p> <span id="s3">Red</span> <br><br>
	Red is the color of extremes. It’s the color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure. Our prehistoric ancestors saw red as the color of fire and blood – energy and primal life forces – and most of red’s symbolism today arises from its powerful associations in the past.</p></div>
